# GlycoTrack MVP — Implementation Plan

## Context

GlycoTrack is a voice-first iOS food-logging app that tracks two independent health metrics simultaneously: Glycemic Load (GL) and Cholesterol Load (CL). The user has provided a complete design document. This plan covers storing that design doc in the repo and building the full MVP from scratch.

## 🎉 Milestone: MVP Deployed to Physical Device (2026-04-20)

The app has been built and deployed to an iPhone running iOS 26 (macOS 26 / Xcode 26.1.1).

### Xcode 26 Compatibility Fixes Applied

Several Xcode 26 / iOS 26 breaking changes required fixes before deployment:

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `CDMEntity initWithXMLElement` crash in Xcode 26's CDMFoundation indexer | Replaced `.xcdatamodeld` file entirely with a programmatic `NSManagedObjectModel` in `GlycoTrackManagedObjectModel.swift` |
| `codeGenerationType="manual"` caused indexer assertion | Removed by switching to programmatic model (no model file) |
| `isDeleted` conflicts with `NSManagedObject` built-in | Renamed attribute to `isSoftDeleted` throughout |
| `timestamp`, `loggedAt`, `id` optional `Date?`/`UUID?` values passed to non-optional APIs | Added `?? Date()` / `?? UUID()` fallbacks at all call sites |
| `navigationTitle(_:displayedComponents:)` removed from SwiftUI in Xcode 26 | Replaced with `navigationTitle(date.formatted(...))` |
| `fill(_:style:)` + `stroke(_:lineWidth:)` chain requires iOS 17 | Replaced with `.fill(...).overlay(stroke(...))` |
| `UIApplication` not in scope in `NotificationManager` | Added `import UIKit` |
| `com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive` unsupported on personal team | Removed entitlement |
| `com.apple.developer.speech-recognition` + `com.apple.security.application-groups` unsupported on personal team | Removed entitlements (add back with paid account) |

### Personal Team Limitations (free Apple ID)

These features are degraded when sideloaded with a free developer account and can be restored with a paid Apple Developer Program membership:

- **Widget data** — App Groups entitlement removed; widget shows empty data
- **Voice logging** — Speech recognition entitlement removed; on-device `SFSpeechRecognizer` still works for iOS 26, server-side recognition unavailable
- **Certificate expiry** — 7-day sideload certificate; reinstall required weekly

---

## Known Limitations (post-MVP)

- `NotificationManager.cancelTodayIfSufficientlyLogged` removes the repeating trigger; future-day notifications only resume when the user opens the app. Users who don't open the app the day after cancelling will miss one notification.
- `usda_nutrition.json` has 377 entries vs DESIGN target of 7,793. Foods without USDA data fall back to GI-only GL calculation with CL=0. Expansion is a post-MVP stretch goal.
- Widget shows empty GL data without App Groups (personal team limitation).

## Post-MVP Iterations (since 2026-04-20 device launch)

Tracks merged PRs that materially shape the product after the initial MVP deployment.

| PR | Title | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| #18 | Visualization overhaul | Emojis replaced food-group color tokens entirely; SpriteKit physics for daily GL bucket; date navigation across visualizations. |
| #19 | Worktree sync rule | Added the rebase-on-start rule to CLAUDE.md so feature branches don't drift behind develop. |
| #20 | Today tab polish + CL viz fixes | Tightened the Today tab; first round of physics tuning on Waterline / Balance scenes. |
| #21 | Unified entry flow + waterline fix + build info | Every entry-tap routes through `FoodEntryDetailSheet` (no more direct edit-jump); `DebugTabView` surfaces git branch / commit / build timestamp via `BuildInfo.generated.swift`. |
| #22 | Week tab + floating tab bar + CL physics | Replaced system `TabView` with two-pill custom bar (record button on right, iOS Weather app pattern); fixed Week tab axis labels and Mon-start week predicate; Waterline floaters now use spring-toward-waterline; Balance scale now locked horizontal until drops settle. |
| #23 | Widget containerBackground | Adopted iOS 17 `.containerBackground(for: .widget)` so the widget renders instead of showing the "adopt containerBackground API" black-rectangle warning. |
| #24 | Codebase cleanup | Removed force-unwraps in date math; deleted dead code in iOS-target `GIEngine.swift`; consolidated `DateFormatter`s into `UI/Theme/DateFormatters.swift`; introduced `APIKey` typed accessor; hoisted CL palette `SKColor`s to `UI/Theme/CLPalette.swift`. |
| (this PR) | Matcher tightening + decomposition prompt + parser tests | Findings from a prod log export (90 active entries) drove three matcher fixes: (a) T1 contains-match gate is now strict `> 0.5` so 1-word generics fall through to T3 instead of latching onto a specific variant (kills `bread→rye bread`, `juice→pomegranate juice`, `chicken→chicken drumstick`); (b) fuzzy match refuses to bridge across prep-method words (`grilled` vs `fried`, `baked` vs `steamed`, etc.) — same Levenshtein distance no longer disguises a different cooking technique with a different CL profile; (c) `decomposeIngredients` system prompt has a new HEADLINE-CARB RULE forcing the named carb (noodles/rice/pasta/bread/…) into the ingredient list, fixing the `hand pulled lamb noodle → lamb + broth` class of silent-GL=0 misses. New `Tests/TranscriptParserCoreTests/` covers parser happy path, malformed responses, prompt-rule regression, and decomposition contract (12 tests). |

## Design vs Implementation Divergences (refreshed)

| DESIGN.md says | Implementation does | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| GI + USDA DBs bundled as SQLite tables | JSON files seeded into Core Data at first launch | Simpler toolchain; no SQLite schema migration needed |
| Core Data `.xcdatamodeld` model file | Programmatic `NSManagedObjectModel` in Swift | Xcode 26 CDMFoundation bug crashes on any `.xcdatamodel` file |
| Tab 1 labelled "Home" | Tab labelled "Today" | More descriptive for a daily-logging app |
| Voice streams audio to Claude in real-time | Apple Speech → transcript → Claude parses text | `SFSpeechRecognizer` runs locally; Claude receives text only |
| Widget is strict mic button | Widget shows GL progress bar + mic deep-link | WidgetKit cannot access microphone |
| Color = food group; food groups have a 6-color palette (DESIGN §6.3, §8) | **Food groups removed entirely.** Each food renders as a single emoji via `FoodEmoji.resolve(entry:)`; tier/confidence tinting kept for the row badge only. | Color-coding by food group never communicated as much as the emoji identity itself; testing showed users read the emoji first. |
| GL × CL Quadrant is a 4-region plot in a modal sheet (DESIGN §8) | **Two-region plot embedded inline** on Today/Week/Month tabs (left/right, GL grows up from a 0 baseline) | Lower half would be permanently empty (GL is unsigned); modal added a tap to no purpose. |
| 5 tabs (Home/Week/Month/Log/Summary) inside the system `TabView` (DESIGN §9) | 7 tabs (Today/Week/Month/Log/Summary/About/Debug) in a custom floating bar with a separated record-button pill on the right | Record action needed to be reachable from any tab; About + Debug are dev-facing. |
| Daily GL budget hardcoded to 100 (DESIGN §3.1) | Constant `dailyGLBudgetUI` in `GLThreshold.swift`; `GIEngineCore` exposes its own `dailyGLBudget` for tests | Two homes is intentional — UI and engine want to evolve independently. iOS-target `GIEngine.swift` no longer redefines it. |
| Tier 5 unrecognized foods (CLAUDE.md) | T5 returns GL=0/CL=0 with explicit "Not recognized" red badge | **Never** silently zero an unrecognized food into a high-confidence match; T5 is the load-bearing failure path. |

## Suggested Next Steps (prioritized)

Concrete, mobile-app-developer-flavored proposals. Roughly grouped by impact ÷ effort. Pick top items per session; not a contract.

### A. Reliability & data quality (do these first)

1. ⚙️ **Expand `usda_nutrition.json`.** First pass landed: 377 → 501 entries (124 curated additions covering all named prod-log gaps — `pine nuts`, `chana masala`, `corn on the cob`, `gooseberries`, `cantaloupe`, etc. — plus common proteins, cheeses, vegetables, and composite dishes). GI-database coverage rose from 367/776 to 488/776, cutting silent CL=0 cases by ~33%. New `scripts/build_usda_nutrition.py` consumes USDA FoodData Central SR Legacy CSVs (`--fdc-dir` flag) and merges them with `scripts/usda_supplement.json`; running with the FDC bundle locally is the path to push past 1,500 entries. Missing GI entries also added: `whole wheat spaghetti` (GI 37), `tomato sauce` (GI 38), `honey wheat bread` (GI 72).
2. ✅ **Add `Tests/TranscriptParserCoreTests/`** — landed in this-PR. 12 tests cover `parse(transcript:)` happy/malformed/preamble/empty paths, `decomposeIngredients` shape, and a regression test pinning the `HEADLINE-CARB RULE` in the system prompt.
3. **CI via GitHub Actions** running `swift test` + `xcodebuild build … iOS Simulator` on every PR. Currently relies on local builds; one rebase-without-rebuild can land a broken `develop`.
4. **Core Data migration plan.** The model is programmatic, so any new attribute is a manual `NSMappingModel` away from a wipe. Either document the "blow away local store on schema change" policy in CLAUDE.md, or wire up a lightweight migration test.
5. **iOS-side matcher regression tests.** This-PR's matcher tightening (gate, prep-method block) is currently only verified by hand against the prod log export. A `Tests/MatchingTests/` target with an in-memory Core Data store would let us pin `bread →∅`, `chicken →∅`, `grilled chicken ↛ fried chicken`, and `white rice → steamed white rice` as named regressions. Needs `PersistenceController.init(inMemory:)` to be `internal`.

### B. UX refinements (visible value to the user)

5. **Settings screen with editable daily GL budget.** Some users have physician-prescribed budgets that differ from the default 100. Today the budget is constant. Stored in `UserDefaults`, default 100, surfaced on Today + Month + summary chips.
6. **Lock-screen / StandBy widget** (`accessoryRectangular`, `accessoryCircular`). Widget extension already exists; iOS 17 lock-screen widget is one extra `WidgetFamily` case + a slimmer view.
7. **Haptic feedback** when an item lands in the bucket / on a balance plate (`UIImpactFeedbackGenerator(style: .light)` from a SpriteKit contact callback). Free polish.
8. **VoiceOver labels** on emoji items in the SpriteKit scenes. Currently every food in the bucket is a generic SKNode with no accessibility label — VoiceOver users can't read the visualizations.
9. **"Refine" affordance on low-confidence rows.** Today the user sees a red badge but has to open the edit sheet and retype. Tap the badge → present a search-style picker against `NutritionalProfile` so the user can promote the entry to a known food in two taps.
10. **Week-over-week comparison strip on the Week tab** ("This week vs last week: GL avg ↓7"). Reuses `PeriodSummaryView`; one extra `@FetchRequest` for the prior week.

### C. Engineering hygiene

11. **Unified logging via `os.Logger`** instead of `print(...)`. Categorized (`network`, `coreData`, `voice`), respects Release builds.
12. **Extract `ClaudeAPIClient`** from `Modules/TranscriptParser/TranscriptParser.swift` into `Modules/ClaudeAPI/`. It's used independently by `SummaryGenerator` and the Edit-recompute path; living inside `TranscriptParser.swift` is a layering smell.
13. **SwiftLint** with rules for `force_unwrapping` (warning), `line_length`, `function_body_length`, `large_tuple`. Catches the kind of issue this PR found by hand.
14. **Profile first-launch seeding.** `PersistenceController.seedNutritionalProfiles()` parses two JSONs and inserts ~1,150 rows on first launch. Visible delay on weak hardware? Move to a background context with a progress hint.
15. **Replace `Bundle.main.infoDictionary` lookups for non-API-key config.** `BuildInfo`, `AppInfo`, and any future runtime flag should follow the `APIKey` enum pattern (typed accessor, single home).

### D. Strategic (multi-PR work, surface area changes)

16. **HealthKit write integration.** Daily GL / CL aggregate writes to HealthKit so other apps (and the watch) can consume. Requires entitlement; gated to paid Apple Developer Program.
17. **Apple Watch complication** showing today's GL ratio. Requires sharing the App Group + a tiny WatchKit target.
18. **Background-refresh widget timeline** so the widget GL number updates without opening the app. Today the widget reads `UserDefaults` and that's only refreshed on log; combine with `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadTimelines(ofKind:)` after every log.
19. **Soft-delete cleanup job** that hard-deletes entries with `isSoftDeleted == true` older than 30 days. Right now soft-deleted rows accumulate forever.
20. **Cohort export** (CSV / Files-app integration). Personal-team users can't use CloudKit; an "Export logs" button writes a CSV they can email to themselves as a primitive backup.

### E. Speculative / research-mode

21. **Photo-based food logging via Vision + Claude vision API.** Already in DESIGN §17 but worth scoping a small spike.
22. **On-device food-name embedding** (e.g. `NaturalLanguage` framework or a tiny CoreML model) to replace Levenshtein in T1/T2 with semantic match. "linguine" → "spaghetti" should resolve without falling all the way to Claude.

## Critical Design Constraints

| Constraint | Implementation |
|---|---|
| GL unsigned | `computedGL` always `max(0, raw)`, Double |
| CL signed | `computedCL` can be negative, Double |
| Daily GL budget 100 | `dailyGLBudgetUI` in `UI/Theme/GLThreshold.swift`; SPM core has its own `dailyGLBudget` |
| Midnight local TZ | `Calendar.current.startOfDay(for: Date())` |
| No raw audio storage | `VoiceCapture` only keeps transcript string |
| iOS 16+ | Core Data (not SwiftData), no `@Observable` macro |
| API key security | From `Info.plist` env var injection via xcconfig, never hardcoded |
